# Stocks
The goal of the project is to construct an application to explore stock market data in processing. The data set we will use is
a public dataset obtained from NYSE and NASDAQ(full 2GB dataset). The application will read in data from a file “daily_prices.csv”,
render it, and allow the user to interact with it.
